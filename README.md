# MNIST-Digit-Classification
This project is intended to document and demonstrate my attempt to develop methods to train deep feedforward neural networks. It has evolved out of the training examples I worked while reading through Michael Nielsen's textbook Neural Networks and Deep Learning, and so resembles his code in some ways.  In particular, I am using his script to process and load the MNIST data.

To load one of my networks, run WeightVisualize.py.  Provide a command line parameter which is a file path to a folder where the network data is stored.  WeightVisualize will run the network, evaluate the classification accuracy on the MNIST test data, and display a pyplot window which visualizes the weight matrices
